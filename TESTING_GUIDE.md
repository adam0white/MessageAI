## Known Issues / Limitations

### Not Fixed (Deferring to Post-MVP)
1. **Durable Object Cleanup:** Old DO instances with message history still exist
   - **Impact:** They'll hibernate and take up minimal resources
   - **Solution:** See CLEANUP.md for manual cleanup options
   
2. **Hash Collision Handling:** No detection for conversation ID hash collisions
   - **Impact:** Extremely low probability (SHA-256)
   - **Solution:** Implement collision detection post-MVP

3. **No Conversation Deletion API:** Can't delete conversations from UI
   - **Impact:** Test conversations accumulate
   - **Solution:** Use CLEANUP.md manual steps for now

## Fresh Start Instructions

If you encounter persistent issues or want to completely reset:

### Full Reset (Nuclear Option)

1. **Sign out all test accounts in app**
2. **Clear backend (already done):**
   ```bash

   wrangler d1 execute messageai-db --remote --command "DELETE FROM conversation_participants"
   wrangler d1 execute messageai-db --remote --command "DELETE FROM conversations"
   wrangler d1 execute messageai-db --remote --command "DELETE FROM users"
   ```

3. **Clear local app data:**
   - iOS Simulator: Delete app ‚Üí Reinstall
   - Android: Settings ‚Üí Apps ‚Üí MessageAI ‚Üí Clear Data

4. **Create fresh test accounts:**
   - Sign up with new email addresses
   - Test with clean slate

## What to Test Next

After verifying all bug fixes work:

1. **Group Chat Features:**
   - Create groups with 3-5 users
