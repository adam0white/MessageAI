# Project Brief: MessageAI

## What We're Building
A production-quality messaging app (like WhatsApp) with AI-enhanced features in one week.

## Timeline
- **MVP**: Tuesday (24 hours) - Hard gate
- **Final**: Sunday 10:59 PM CT (7 days)

## MVP Must-Haves (24 Hours)
1. One-on-one chat with real-time delivery
2. Message persistence (survives restart)
3. Optimistic UI updates
4. Online/offline status
5. User authentication
6. Group chat (3+ users)
7. Read receipts
8. Push notifications (foreground minimum)
9. Deployed backend

## After MVP
- Choose 1 persona (Remote Team, International, Parent, or Creator)
- Build 5 required AI features for that persona
- Build 1 advanced AI capability
- Use LLMs + RAG + agent frameworks

## Philosophy
*"Simple + reliable + useful AI > feature-rich + flaky"*

Messages must never be lost. Everything else is secondary.

## Development Principles
- **Specify what and why, not how** - Trust implementation decisions, focus on outcomes
- **Working state is sacred** - Every commit must be deployable; test before committing
- **Debug deeply** - Understand the problem before fixing; read errors completely
- **Consult latest docs** - Platforms evolve; check documentation when stuck
- **Clean as you go** - Delete scaffolding docs when done; keep only what's useful
- **Know when to stop** - Document blockers instead of spinning on impossible tasks
