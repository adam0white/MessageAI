## What's Left
- Phase 10+: Polish, demo video

## Known Limitations (Require Phase 4 - Push Notifications)
1. **Read receipts only work when sender is online**
   - When sender closes chat, they don't receive read receipt updates
   - Recipient reads message → sender's checkmarks stay gray (not green)
   - Solution: Push notifications to update status even when disconnected
2. **Background messages not received**
   - Messages only received when chat screen is active
   - Root cause: Per-conversation WebSocket pattern (one WS per chat)
   - Solution: Push notifications (Phase 4) - standard mobile messaging pattern
3. **Status updates require active connection**
   - Sender must have chat open to see delivered/read status changes
   - This is by design - WebSocket only sends to connected clients
   - Solution: Push notifications + background status sync

## Blockers
None!
