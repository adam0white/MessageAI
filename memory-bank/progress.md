## MVP Progress (10/11) - Almost Complete!
- ✅ User authentication (Clerk) - **Working**
- ✅ One-on-one chat with real-time delivery - **Working**
- ✅ Message persistence (survives restart) - **Working**
- ✅ Optimistic UI updates - **Working**
- ✅ Online/offline status indicators - **Working**
- ✅ Message timestamps - **Working**
- ✅ Group chat functionality (3+ users) - **Implemented & Deployed**
- ✅ Message read receipts - **Enhanced with colored indicators**
- ✅ Presence tracking - **Online user count in groups**
- ✅ Deployed backend (Cloudflare Workers) - **Production Live**
- [ ] Push notifications (foreground) - **Next: Phase 4**

## Testing Scenarios (4/7 - Validated on Real Devices)
- ✅ **Two devices real-time chat** - WORKING when both chats open (Android + iPhone)
- ✅ **Force-quit persistence** - Messages survive app restart
- ✅ **Rapid-fire messages** - Multiple messages sent/received successfully
- ✅ **Connection status** - Green dot shows connected, auto-reconnect works
- 🚧 **Offline → online sync** - Implemented but needs more testing
- 🚧 **Backgrounded app messages** - Requires push notifications (Phase 4)
- ⏳ **Group chat (3+ participants)** - Phase 3

## Task Progress by Phase
- **Phase 1.0**: 9/9 ✅ (100%)
- **Phase 2.0**: 9/9 ✅ (100%)
- **Phase 3.0**: 6/6 ✅ (100%)
- **Phase 4.0**: 0/6 (Next)

## What Works (Production-Ready Features)
- ✅ Complete authentication flow (Email/password, Clerk)
- ✅ **Real-time WebSocket messaging** (tested on Android ↔ iPhone)
- ✅ **Group chat with 3+ participants** (Phase 3)
- ✅ **SHA-256 conversation IDs** for scalable groups
- ✅ **Sender name attribution** in group messages
- ✅ **Presence tracking** with online user counts
- ✅ **Enhanced read receipts** (blue ✓✓ for read, gray for sent)
- ✅ Optimistic UI updates (messages appear immediately)
- ✅ Message persistence (survives force-quit)
- ✅ Offline message queue with auto-sync
- ✅ Network monitoring with auto-reconnection
- ✅ Chat screen with bubbles, timestamps, status indicators
- ✅ Conversation list with pull-to-refresh
- ✅ Group creation UI with type selector
- ✅ Deterministic conversation IDs (no duplicates)
- ✅ Historical message loading on reconnection
- ✅ Self-chat, 1-on-1, and group support
- ✅ Deployed to Cloudflare Workers production
- ✅ D1 database with migrations
- ✅ Durable Objects with SQLite enabled

## What's Left
- Phase 4.0: Push Notifications & Final Deployment (6 tasks)
- Post-MVP: AI Features
- Testing: Comprehensive end-to-end testing on multiple devices

## Known Limitations (Architectural - For Future Phases)
1. **Background messages** - Only received when chat is open
   - Root cause: Per-conversation WebSocket pattern
   - Solution: Push notifications (Phase 4) - proper mobile pattern
2. **Historical messages** - New devices don't see full history
   - Root cause: History loading just implemented, needs more work
   - Solution: Completed basic implementation, test more
3. **Group chat IDs** - Will be very long with many participants
   - Root cause: Using `conv_user1_user2_user3` format
   - Solution: SHA-256 hash in Phase 3
4. **Delta sync** - Fetches all conversations on each refresh
   - Root cause: No timestamp-based filtering
   - Solution: Add `after` parameter to API (Phase 4)

## Blockers
None!

## Key Achievements
- ✅ Full real-time messaging infrastructure
- ✅ Optimistic updates for instant UX
- ✅ Offline-first architecture
- ✅ Type-safe WebSocket protocol
- ✅ Durable Objects for message persistence
- ✅ CORS-enabled REST API for conversations
- ✅ React Query cache synchronization

## Next Actions
1. **TESTING PHASE**: Validate all messaging scenarios
2. Deploy Worker to Cloudflare (Task 4.4)
3. Test on two physical devices
4. Begin Phase 3.0: Group Chat features
5. Implement push notifications (Phase 4.0)

*Real-time messaging is fully functional and ready for testing!*
