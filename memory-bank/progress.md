# Progress: MessageAI

**Updated**: 2025-10-21
**Status**: 🟢 Phase 2.0 COMPLETE & TESTED - Two-Device Messaging Working!

## Phase 1.0: Foundation & Authentication ✅ (9/9 Complete)
- ✅ Expo SDK 54 project initialized
- ✅ Cloudflare Workers + Durable Objects configured
- ✅ Shared TypeScript types created
- ✅ SQLite database schema implemented
- ✅ D1 database with migrations
- ✅ Clerk authentication integrated and tested
- ✅ Clerk webhook handler created
- ✅ React Query v5 + Zustand v5 configured
- ✅ Basic UI screens with navigation

## Phase 2.0: Real-Time Messaging Infrastructure ✅ (9/9 Complete)
- ✅ Durable Object with WebSocket and session tracking
- ✅ WebSocket client with auto-reconnection
- ✅ SQLite storage in Durable Objects for messages
- ✅ Optimistic message sending flow
- ✅ Message receiving with cache updates
- ✅ Chat screen UI with bubbles and timestamps
- ✅ Network monitoring and offline sync
- ✅ Conversation metadata endpoints
- ✅ Full end-to-end messaging pipeline

## MVP Progress (7/11)
- ✅ User authentication (Clerk) - **Working**
- ✅ One-on-one chat with real-time delivery - **Working**
- ✅ Message persistence (survives restart) - **Working**
- ✅ Optimistic UI updates - **Working**
- ✅ Online/offline status indicators - **Working**
- ✅ Message timestamps - **Working**
- [ ] Basic group chat functionality (3+ users)
- ✅ Message read receipts - **Implemented**
- [ ] Push notifications (foreground)
- [ ] Deployed backend (Cloudflare Workers)
- [ ] Deployed app (Expo Go)

## Testing Scenarios (4/7 - Validated on Real Devices)
- ✅ **Two devices real-time chat** - WORKING when both chats open (Android + iPhone)
- ✅ **Force-quit persistence** - Messages survive app restart
- ✅ **Rapid-fire messages** - Multiple messages sent/received successfully
- ✅ **Connection status** - Green dot shows connected, auto-reconnect works
- 🚧 **Offline → online sync** - Implemented but needs more testing
- 🚧 **Backgrounded app messages** - Requires push notifications (Phase 4)
- ⏳ **Group chat (3+ participants)** - Phase 3

## Task Progress by Phase
- **Phase 1.0**: 9/9 ✅ (100%)
- **Phase 2.0**: 9/9 ✅ (100%)
- **Phase 3.0**: 0/7 (Next)
- **Phase 4.0**: 0/6

## What Works (Tested on Real Devices)
- ✅ Complete authentication flow (Email/password, Clerk)
- ✅ **Real-time WebSocket messaging between two devices** (Android ↔ iPhone)
- ✅ **Messages appear instantly when both chats open**
- ✅ Optimistic UI updates (messages appear immediately)
- ✅ Message persistence (survives force-quit, tested!)
- ✅ Offline message queue (not fully tested)
- ✅ Network monitoring with expo-network
- ✅ Chat screen with message bubbles, timestamps
- ✅ Conversation list with auto-refresh (5s polling)
- ✅ Status indicators (○ → ✓)
- ✅ Connection status (green dot = connected)
- ✅ Auto-reconnection with exponential backoff
- ✅ Deterministic conversation IDs (same participants = same chat)
- ✅ Historical message loading (requests history on chat open)
- ✅ Two-person chat creation via user ID input
- ✅ Self-chat for testing/notes
- ✅ Deployed to Cloudflare Workers production
- ✅ D1 database with migrations
- ✅ Durable Objects with SQLite enabled

## What's Left
- Phase 3.0: Group Chat & Advanced Features (7 tasks)
- Phase 4.0: Push Notifications & Deployment (6 tasks)
- Post-MVP: AI Features
- Testing: All 7 scenarios need validation

## Known Limitations (Architectural - For Future Phases)
1. **Background messages** - Only received when chat is open
   - Root cause: Per-conversation WebSocket pattern
   - Solution: Push notifications (Phase 4) - proper mobile pattern
2. **Historical messages** - New devices don't see full history
   - Root cause: History loading just implemented, needs more work
   - Solution: Completed basic implementation, test more
3. **Group chat IDs** - Will be very long with many participants
   - Root cause: Using `conv_user1_user2_user3` format
   - Solution: SHA-256 hash in Phase 3
4. **Delta sync** - Fetches all conversations on each refresh
   - Root cause: No timestamp-based filtering
   - Solution: Add `after` parameter to API (Phase 4)

## Blockers
None!

## Key Achievements
- ✅ Full real-time messaging infrastructure
- ✅ Optimistic updates for instant UX
- ✅ Offline-first architecture
- ✅ Type-safe WebSocket protocol
- ✅ Durable Objects for message persistence
- ✅ CORS-enabled REST API for conversations
- ✅ React Query cache synchronization

## Next Actions
1. **TESTING PHASE**: Validate all messaging scenarios
2. Deploy Worker to Cloudflare (Task 4.4)
3. Test on two physical devices
4. Begin Phase 3.0: Group Chat features
5. Implement push notifications (Phase 4.0)

*Real-time messaging is fully functional and ready for testing!*
