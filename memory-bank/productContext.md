# Product Context: MessageAI

## Why This Exists
WhatsApp was built by 2 developers in months. With modern AI tools, we can build comparable quality in one week PLUS add intelligent features.

## Core Problem
Build messaging that:
- Delivers messages instantly when online
- Queues and syncs when offline  
- Never loses data, even on crashes
- Handles poor networks gracefully

## Testing Scenarios
1. Two devices real-time chat
2. Offline → messages → back online
3. Force-quit and reopen
4. Poor network conditions
5. Group chat (3+ users)

## Personas (Choose ONE After MVP)
- **Remote Team Professional**: Thread summaries, action items, priority detection
- **International Communicator**: Real-time translation, cultural context
- **Busy Parent/Caregiver**: Calendar extraction, decision tracking, RSVPs
- **Content Creator/Influencer**: DM categorization, auto-responses, sentiment analysis

Each has 5 required AI features + 1 advanced capability.
