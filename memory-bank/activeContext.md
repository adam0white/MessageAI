# Active Context: MessageAI

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-21  
**Phase**: Ready for Development - Task 1.1

## Current Focus
Task list complete with 31 MVP sub-tasks. Ready to initialize Expo project (Task 1.1).

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Initialize Expo project with TypeScript
2. Set up Cloudflare Workers project structure
3. Configure Clerk authentication
4. Build basic UI screens before connecting backend
5. Start incremental development: UI → Auth → 1-on-1 chat → Group chat → Read receipts → Notifications

## Key Decisions Made
- ✅ Platform: React Native with Expo
- ✅ Backend: Cloudflare Workers + Durable Objects + D1 + R2
- ✅ Authentication: Clerk
- ✅ State Management: React Query (server state) + Zustand (app state)
- ✅ Persona: Remote Team Professional with Proactive Assistant (post-MVP)
- ✅ Communication: WebSocket (JSON) + Workers RPC

## Key Decisions Pending
- [ ] UI component library choice (Expo defaults vs third-party)
- [ ] Conversation creation UX flow
- [ ] LLM provider for AI features (OpenAI vs Anthropic)

## Recent Changes
- Comprehensive PRD created: `prd-messageai.md`
- Task list created: `tasks/tasks-prd-messageai.md`
- 31 MVP sub-tasks defined across 4 phases
- Architecture finalized with RPC-first approach
- Testing strategy defined (physical devices, Expo Go)

## Next Session
Begin development starting with Task 1.1: Initialize Expo project with TypeScript template.
