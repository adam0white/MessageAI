- âœ… AI button (blue when active)
- âœ… AI responses as messages (visible to all)

**Fixes:**

---

**Phase 4 Achievements (Oct 22, 2025):**

**Final Implementation (Polling + Local Notifications):**
- âœ… **Foreground Notifications Working**: Polling + local notifications (no FCM needed)
- âœ… **useGlobalMessages Hook**: Polls conversations API every 3s, detects new messages
- âœ… **Local Notification Display**: Shows notifications for messages from inactive conversations  
- âœ… **Notification Tap Navigation**: Tapping notification opens the correct conversation
- âœ… **Test Button**: Added ðŸ”” button in conversation list to verify notifications work
- âœ… **Works Everywhere**: Expo Go, development builds, and production (no special setup)
- âœ… **Permission Handling**: Proper Android 13+ permission flow with channels created first
- âœ… **Backend Infrastructure Ready**: Push token endpoints, Expo Push API integration (for future FCM upgrade)

**Architecture Insights:**
- ðŸ”§ Per-conversation WebSocket limitation identified: Users on conversation list aren't connected to any DO
- ðŸ”§ Polling solution: Simple, reliable, works without FCM complexity
- ðŸ”§ Local notifications: Trigger via `scheduleNotificationAsync` with `trigger: null`
- ðŸ”§ Active conversation tracking: Skip notifications for currently viewed chat
- ðŸ”§ Deduplication: Track notified message IDs to prevent spam

**Known Limitations (By Design for MVP):**
- **Polling-based**: 3-second interval, 0-3s notification delay (acceptable for MVP)
- **Foreground only**: App must be open to receive notifications (closed app requires FCM)
- **Generic notification body**: Shows "You have a new message" (message content in DO, not D1)
- **Future enhancements**: Global user WebSocket for instant notifications, FCM for background, message preview in notification

**Phase 3 Achievements (Oct 22, 2025):**
- âœ… **SHA-256 Conversation Hashing**: Scalable group IDs using crypto hashing for 3+ participants
- âœ… **Simplified Conversation Creation**: Single UI that auto-detects type (1=self, 2=direct, 3+=group), name optional for all
- âœ… **Sender Attribution**: Messages in group chats show sender names above bubbles
- âœ… **Presence Tracking**: Real-time online/offline status tracking in Durable Objects
- âœ… **Presence UI**: Online count displayed for ALL chat types ("X online")
- âœ… **Auto-mark-as-read**: Messages automatically marked as read when viewed
- âœ… **Enhanced Status Indicators**: Gray â—‹ â†’ âœ“ â†’ âœ“âœ“ â†’ **Green âœ“âœ“** (read)
- âœ… **Retroactive Delivery**: Messages marked delivered when recipient fetches history
- âœ… **Message Deduplication**: No duplicate messages after reconnection
- âœ… **Database Cleanup**: Local DB cleared on logout (user data isolation)
- âœ… **Backend Deployed**: Version 6bfee91f at https://messageai-worker.abdulisik.workers.dev

**Architecture Enhancements:**
- ðŸ”§ Unified architecture: Self-chat, 1-on-1, and group chat use same infrastructure
- ðŸ”§ Deterministic IDs: Simple concat for 1-2 users, SHA-256 hash for 3+
- ðŸ”§ Presence broadcasts: Join/leave events automatically sent to all participants
- ðŸ”§ Type-safe WebSocket protocol: ConnectedEvent includes onlineUserIds list
- ðŸ”§ Auto read receipts: Sent automatically when messages viewed
- ðŸ”§ Broadcast return count: Backend checks actual delivery, not just session count

**Validated on Real Devices (iOS Simulator + Android Physical)**:
1. âœ… Group chat with 3 users working perfectly
2. âœ… Online count updates in real-time (join/leave)
3. âœ… Sender names displayed in group messages
4. âœ… Status progression: gray â—‹ â†’ âœ“ â†’ âœ“âœ“ â†’ green âœ“âœ“
5. âœ… Read receipts sent automatically when viewing
6. âœ… Offline messages synced on reconnection
7. âœ… No duplicate messages
8. âœ… Logout clears database properly

**Next Phase:** Phase 4.5-4.7 - Final MVP Deployment & Documentation

**Known Limitations (Acceptable for MVP):**
- **Foreground notifications only**: Notifications work when app is open (3s polling). Background requires FCM (future phase).
- **Generic notification text**: Shows "You have a new message" instead of content. Message content stored in Durable Objects, not D1.
- **Read receipts require sender online**: Green checkmarks only update when sender is connected. Requires FCM push for offline updates.
- No user search/directory (currently paste user IDs manually)
