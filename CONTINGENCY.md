# ðŸš¨ Contingency Plan: If You're Behind Schedule

## At 8 Hours (AI Features Phase)

**If not done with all 5 AI features:**
- Simplify features to use basic prompts without complex RAG
- Skip smart search (most complex) if necessary
- Focus on getting 4/5 working well rather than all 5 half-working
- Use Workers AI simple models instead of advanced features

## At 13 Hours (Deployment Phase)

**If not deployed:**
- Use `npx expo publish` (faster than EAS build)
- Test on one physical device minimum instead of two
- Skip iOS TestFlight, focus on Expo Go or Android APK

## At 18 Hours (Documentation Phase)

**If demo video not recorded:**
- Record without editing
- Use simple screen recording only (no fancy production)
- 3-4 minutes instead of 5-7 if needed

## At 21 Hours (Final Phase)

**If still not complete:**
- Simplify demo video to 3 minutes minimum
- Use AI (ChatGPT/Claude) to help write documentation quickly
- Skip buffer time and work straight through
- Social post can be simple (2 sentences + video link)

## General Fallback Strategy

**Priority Order (Don't Compromise):**
1. âœ… All 5 AI features working (even if basic)
2. âœ… Demo video (even if simple)
3. âœ… Persona brainlift (even if 1 page basic)
4. âœ… Social post (even if minimal)

**Can Simplify:**
- Advanced AI capability (3-step instead of 5-step workflow)
- Documentation quality (basic README instead of comprehensive)
- Testing scope (core scenarios only)

**Can Skip if Desperate:**
- Typing indicators (nice-to-have)
- Member list UI (minor feature)
- Perfect deployment (local setup instructions okay)

## Emergency Time Recovery

**If 2+ hours behind:**
- Skip all buffer time
- Reduce testing from 3h to 1.5h (focus on critical scenarios only)
- Reduce demo video from 3h to 1.5h (no editing, just recording)
- Use AI to generate documentation drafts

**If 4+ hours behind:**
- Simplify advanced AI capability to basic multi-step (2-3 steps)
- Skip one AI feature (choose smart search - most complex)
- Minimal demo video (3 minutes, core features only)
- Basic persona brainlift (template-based)

**Critical Threshold:**
- Must have: 4/5 AI features, demo video, brainlift, social post
- These are hard requirements for passing grade
